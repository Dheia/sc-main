---------

Sorry the public repos are a mess and half done. We're spending so much time gathering ideas, researching methods to create the ideas, coding them, debug and testing the code and keep repeating the process. We use summer CMS everyday and every 1-2 weeks keep releasing major updates and several times daily minor updates! This has gone on for over a year now. We hope to expand the coding team to around 30 members full time and release an exciting candidate release in the near future! Before the release all the public repos and docs will be finished off and we welcome alpha testers. Right now we are focused with the coding in the private repo's.
  
DEVELOPMENT IS CURRENTLY BEING FOCUSED ON THE FOLLOWING MODULES:
  
  - SECURITY
  - PERFORMANCE
  - LEGAL
  - DEVELOPER
  - FRAMEWORKS
  - PARSER
  - CORE
  - UI

  WHEN THESE HAVE BEEN COMPLETED WE WILL FOCUS ON ALL THE OTHER MODULES...

## Transparency üì¢

This project is completely transparent and honest, before we started we contacted and discussed this project with the authors and admins of the October project. We have given the links to this repo to the authors and we continue to be transparent throughout the whole process! We feel it's important to state this and be open from day one! This repo links all the modules that make up the Summer CMS upgrade proposal. Instead of writing ideas and suggestions, we have taken a pro-active approach and are actively coding a fully working solution! The code is held on private repo's, due to the code being heavily developed and changed on a daily basis. We will release a stable test release to the admins and authors in private for feedback before releasing to the general public for beta-testing. This is a long-term project and we will continue to grow!

Over years we have coded and created well over a hundred pull requests (under various github accounts) which have been merged to the October core, we have never asked or recevived any money for any of the pull requests. We use the cms for professional purposes and therefore it is beneficial for our companies to have a professional working solution to give to our end-users and clients. In order for us to delivery a high quality product we made the discussion to update the cms with new and exciting features and modernize old and existing features, there are breaking change!

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summer-cms/sc-main/blob/main/src/assets/images/vanilla.jpg"></p>

## Vanilla Code üç¶

Vanilla often refers to **pure** or **plain**. So in terms of programming languages, it means either without the use of **3rd party libraries** or without the use of **frameworks**.

The `core` files and `modules` in Summer CMS use `Laravel`, an open-source PHP web framework. However, all the styling, javascript and data interchange formats have been written using `vanilla` code. This makes upgrading the code **quick** and **simple** without the constraints of relying solely on a single library or framework! Plus reducing the code size and optimizing the performance by reducing the overheads of loading third-party libraries (such as jQuery as an example). Summer CMS treats all third-party libraries and frameworks as optional extras and developers are welcome to use any of them to enhance their websites and applications using Summer CMS.

The [framework module](https://github.com/summer-cms/sc-framework-module) adds bridges and interconnects different frameworks to Summer CMS with ease to give a customized experience for each framework!

## Naming Prefix ‚úíÔ∏è

**Summer CMS uses the `sc-` naming prefix to advoid conflicts.**

## Requirements üö©

This module has been optimized to work with php `7.4.x` and `8.x` versions - we recommend upgrading from any lower php version.

The security module builds and creates the `.htaccess` file with the following sections:

- Backward Compatibility
- Cross Origins
- Errors
- Firewall
- HTTP Headers
- Media Types
- Rewrite Rules
- Security
- SSL
- Web Performance

## PSR ‚ôªÔ∏è

This legal module uses some PSR standards to be the most interoperable possible:

- [PSR-6](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/) Caching Interface.
- [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) Standard interfaces to represent http requests, responses and uris.
- [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/) Standard factories to create PSR-7 objects.
- [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) Standard interface to send a http request and return a response.

We also suggest using Cross-browser testing provided by BrowserStack (*) where a real-browser can't be used in-house.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summer-cms/sc-main/blob/main/src/assets/images/browser-stack.png"></p>

## PHP Coding Standards Fixer ‚≠ï

The PHP Coding Standards Fixer (PHP CS Fixer) tool fixes your code to follow standards; whether you want to follow PHP coding standards as defined in the PSR-1, PSR-2, etc., or other community driven ones like the Symfony one.

### Installation üîπ

The recommended way to install PHP CS Fixer is to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) in a dedicated `composer.json` file in your project, for example in the
`tools/php-cs-fixer` directory:

```console
$ mkdir --parents tools/php-cs-fixer
$ composer require --working-dir=tools/php-cs-fixer friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer
```

For more details and other installation methods, see: [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).

### Usage üî∏

Assuming you installed PHP CS Fixer as instructed above, you can run the following command to fix the files PHP files in the `src` directory:

```console
$ tools/php-cs-fixer/vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix src
```

(*) Change the above command to the correct folder location.

### Testing ‚öôÔ∏è

All the modules including the Summer CMS core uses the following:

- A [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de) test suite.
- A coding style compliance test suite using [PHP CS Fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/).
- A code analysis compliance test suite using [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan).

To run the tests, run the following command from the project folder.

```bash
$ composer test
```

## Semantic Versioning üéÅ

The Summer CMS and all modules use: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summer-cms/sc-security-module/blob/master/src/assets/images/semver.png"></p>

Semantic Versioning is a 3-component number in the format of `X.Y.Z` where:

- X stands for a major version.
- Y stands for a minor version.
- Z stands for a patch.

The goal of Semantic Versioning is to bring some sanity to the management of rapidly moving software release targets. As discussed above, 3 numbers i.e, `Major`, `Minor` and `Patch` are required to identify a software version. For example, if we take version `5.12.2`, then it has a `major` version of 5, a `minor` version of 12 and a `patch` version of 2.

Below are some scenarios when Summer CMS creates a new version release:

- Bump the value of X when breaking the existing API.
- Bump the value of Y when implementing new features in a backward-compatible way.
- Bump the value of Z when fixing bugs.

Pre-release metadata is identified by appending a hyphen to the end of the Semantic Versioning sequence. Thus a pre-release for version 1.0.0 could be `1.0.0-alpha.1`. Then if another build is needed, it would become `1.0.0-alpha.2` and so on. Note that names cannot contain leading zeros, but hyphens are allowed in names for pre-release identifiers.

Summer CMS uses the following pre-release metadata:

| Version     | Description        |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| 3.3.x-aplha | The alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase of software testing. |
| 3.3.x-beta  | The beta phase follows after the alpha phase. A Beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs. |
| 3.3.x-rc    | A release candidate (RC), is a beta version with potential to becoming a stable product and is ready to release unless significant bugs emerge. |
