## Servers üîß

### Apache Server üõ†Ô∏è

#### Enable the following Apache httpd modules

We have a dedicated Apache section for users using `.htaccess` some configurations won't have any effect if the appropriate modules aren't enabled. So, in order for everything to work as intended, you need to ensure the you have the following Apache modules enabled:

- [`mod_autoindex.c` (autoindex_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_autoindex.html)
- [`mod_deflate.c` (deflate_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_deflate.html)
- [`mod_expires.c` (expires_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_expires.html)
- [`mod_filter.c` (filter_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_filter.html)
- [`mod_headers.c` (headers_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_headers.html)
- [`mod_include.c` (include_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_include.html)
- [`mod_mime.c` (mime_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_mime.html)
- [`mod_rewrite.c` (rewrite_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html)

##### Support

 * Apache **2.4.10 or greater** (we are looking at adding some version 2.5 features in the near future)

#### Limits

> We have placed a `soft` **limit of 50Mb uncompressed or less** for the creation of the `.htaccess` file by this module. Developers and webmasters are allowed to go over the limit. This limit is set by the security module when generating the `.htaccess` file under its performance specs.

#### Default File Creation

The security module builds and creates the `.htaccess` file with the following sections:

- Backward Compatibility
- Cross Origins
- Errors
- Firewall
- HTTP Headers
- Media Types
- Rewrite Rules
- Security
- SSL
- Web Performance
