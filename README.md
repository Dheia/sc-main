## Transparency üì¢

This project is completely transparent and honest, before we started we contacted and discussed this project with the authors and admins of the October project. We have given the links to this repo to the authors and we continue to be transparent throughout the whole process! We feel it's important to state this and be open from day one! This repo links all the modules that make up the Summer CMS upgrade proposal. Instead of writing ideas and suggestions, we have taken a pro-active approach and are actively coding a fully working solution! The code is held on private repo's, due to the code being heavily developed and changed on a daily basis. We will release a stable test release to the admins and authors in private for feedback before releasing to the general public for beta-testing. This is a long-term project and we will continue to grow!

Over years we have coded and created well over a hundred pull requests (under various github accounts) which have been merged to the October core, we have never asked or recevived any money for any of the pull requests. We use the cms for professional purposes and therefore it is beneficial for our companies to have a professional working solution to give to our end-users and clients. In order for us to delivery a high quality product we made the discussion to update the cms with new and exciting features and modernize old and existing features, there are breaking change!

## Servers üîß

### Apache Server üõ†Ô∏è

#### Enable the following Apache httpd modules

We have a dedicated Apache section for users using `.htaccess` some configurations won't have any effect if the appropriate modules aren't enabled. So, in order for everything to work as intended, you need to ensure the you have the following Apache modules enabled:

- [`mod_autoindex.c` (autoindex_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_autoindex.html)
- [`mod_deflate.c` (deflate_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_deflate.html)
- [`mod_expires.c` (expires_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_expires.html)
- [`mod_filter.c` (filter_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_filter.html)
- [`mod_headers.c` (headers_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_headers.html)
- [`mod_include.c` (include_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_include.html)
- [`mod_mime.c` (mime_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_mime.html)
- [`mod_rewrite.c` (rewrite_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html)
- [`mod_setenvif.c` (setenvif_module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_setenvif.html)

For more detailed information on configuration files and how to use them, please check the appropriate Apache documentation:

- https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/configuring.html
- https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html

##### Support

 * Apache **2.4.10 or greater** (we are looking at adding some version 2.5 features in the near future)

#### Limits

> We have placed a `soft` **limit of 50Mb uncompressed or less** for the creation of the `.htaccess` file by this module. Developers and webmasters are allowed to go over the limit. This limit is set by the security module when generating the `.htaccess` file under its performance specs.

#### Default File Creation

The security module builds and creates the `.htaccess` file with the following sections:

- Backward Compatibility
- Cross Origins
- Errors
- Firewall
- HTTP Headers
- Media Types
- Rewrite Rules
- Security
- SSL
- Web Performance

(*) Disclaimer: Above is a brief list and not intended to be a complete list.

## Reporting a Vulnerability üí•

We strive to make the code accessible to a wide audience of beginner and experienced users.

We welcome bug reports, false positive alert reports, evasions, usability issues, and suggestions for new detections. Submit these types of non-vulnerability related issues via Github.

Please include your installed version and the relevant portions of your audit log.

False negative or common bypasses should [create an issue](https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/sc-main/issues/new) so they can be addressed.

Do this before submitting a vulnerability:

1) Verify that you have the latest version of Summer CMS.
2) Validate which Paranoia Level this bypass applies to. If it works in PL4, please send us an email.
3) If you detected anything that causes unexpected behavior of the engine via manipulation of existing provided rules, please send it by email.

We are happy to work with the community to provide CVE identifiers for any discovered security issues if requested.

If in doubt, feel free to reach out to us!

### Notes

(1) Microsoft announced on 17 August that Edge Legacy will have its life support switched off on 9 March 2021, Summer CMS will support Edge Chromium only.

(2) Internet Explorer version 1-11, Summer CMS will not support due to only supporting `Evergreen` brwosers.

For a full list of browser support with Summer CMS, see here: [Browser Support](https://github.com/ayumi-cloud/sc-main/blob/main/docs/browser_support.md).

**Note:** Please use Unit Testing and Coding Best Practices in order to have a valid pull request üòâ

Patches and pull requests are encouraged. All code should follow the [PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) style guidelines. **Please include unit tests whenever possible!**

### PSR ‚ôªÔ∏è

This legal module uses some PSR standards to be the most interoperable possible:

- [PSR-6](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/) Caching Interface.
- [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) Standard interfaces to represent http requests, responses and uris.
- [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/) Standard factories to create PSR-7 objects.
- [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) Standard interface to send a http request and return a response.

We also suggest using Cross-browser testing provided by BrowserStack (*) where a real-browser can't be used in-house.
